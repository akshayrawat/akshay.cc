  <p>Part of <a href="http://www.auctionful.com">Auctionful.com&#39;s</a> designs were crowdsourced at <a href="http://99designs.com/">99designs</a>. Having run a few design contests, here are some quick tips to effectively run one.</p>

<h4>Invite designers</h4>

<p>Instead of waiting for your contest to be discovered, invite designers as soon as you start the contest. If its a logo contest, visit the <a href="http://99designs.com/logo-design/store">Logo Store</a> and invite the designers of designs you like. If its web design or something else, invite the winners of the last 15 contests in that category. This is a relatively low effort high yield tactic.</p>

<h4>Make your contest blind</h4>

<p>I found that most good designers participate only in <a href="http://99designs.com/help/what-are-blind-contests">blind contests</a>. Having seen both sides of it, turning a contest blind really made it easier to sort out the good designers from the average ones. When a contest was not blind, a lot of average designers would rip off designs which got a good score - making it hard to differentiate. You don&#39;t want such designers as they will struggle with design tweaks in later rounds.</p>

<h4>Set clear expectations on feedback.</h4>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of contest holders struggle with providing feedback in Round 1. This is a hard job as contests get hundreds of submissions. So its really important to publish the rules of feedback in the beginning. My rules for feedback for Round 1 are always posted publicly - If I like your design concept, I&#39;ll provide you feedback 2 or 3 times. If your design gets eliminated without any feedback, then please try a new design concept. Most times when I eliminated, I would drop a quick line, and an encouragement to try another concept.</p>

<p>Setting these ground rules straight prevented designers from personal messaging me all time.</p>

<h4>Set goals for each round</h4>

<p>A lot of designers tend to focus too much on one design in the first round. What you really want in the first round is a lot of design options. Usually I do things to narrow the designer&#39;s focus. For example. I ask them to submit their design in just 1 color variation in round 1. In round 2, we do design tweaks, multiple color variations etc. Also, in round 1, I ask them to quickly move on to another concept if their current one is good enough to compete in the next round. Ideally, you want multiple design submissions in round 1 from the same set of designers you like.</p>

<h4>Top $$$ does not attract the best talent.</h4>

<p>A better managed contest definitely attracts more designers than high paying ones. A little bit of research into past auctions prizes will keep you from over spending.
I&#39;m really not sure how effective the contest add-ons are. The 99Designs&#39;s twitter feeds is really busy, so I&#39;m not sure if a promotion there is worth paying for.</p>

<h4>Keep the dashboard as clean as possible.</h4>

<p>Another trick to keep getting more and more submissions is to keep the &#39;All Active&#39; section of the dashboard as clean as possible. If a concept has no prospect, eliminate it. Most designers coming to your contests see the &#39;Active&#39; board first, and its really not encouraging to see a crowded lot.</p>

<h4>Not just a contest</h4>

<p>Its not just about the design contest. I also found 99Designs to be a good place find design talent for my project.</p>

<h4>Auctionful&#39;s contests</h4>

<p>Two of Auctionful&#39;s recents contests are <a href="https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/create-next-logo-auctionful-127807">here</a> and <a href="https://99designs.com/icon-button-design/contests/button-design-auctionful-176776">here</a>.</p>
